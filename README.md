# IR-Assignment-3

## Description
This IR Assignment requires students to:
- Perform feature selection, using 4 approaches
- Perform text classification, using Naive Bayes

### Feature Selection
For feature selection, the 4 approaches outlined are:
- Term-Freq/Inverse-Doc-Freq (tf * idf); Select top 100 features based on tf-idf score. (tf, df frequency thresholds can be adjusted)
- Topic Terms co-occurrence; Find top 50 most frequent nouns, call this a Topics base-set. Then find all co-occurences of terms in the Topic base-set, and append each co-occurence in a relevant topic set.
- Lexical Chains; lexical chains is a sequence of related words, that can span either a few sentences (or neighbouring words), or an entire text. (Threshold for choosing lexical chains can be adjusted)
- All the aforementioned features in combination
